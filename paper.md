# Summary
The FITS format (Flexible Image Transport System) [@Hanisch:2001] is a widely used format to
store astronomical data. It is used to store a lot of different types of data such as 1D or 2D spectra, 
3D data cubes. It has been developed in the late 1970 to reach its final form almost two decades ago. 
FITS files are built with two components. The data themselves are stored as tables and contains 
any types of data. A header is built containing set of keywords-value pairs aiming at describing 
the data themselves.

Accessing and displaying metadata inside FITS files is important in order to get an overview
of what is inside these files. It is particularly useful when dealing with large amount
of files at once. Tools have been already publicly available for years with the dfits 
and fitsort algorithms (the documentation is available here 
https://www.eso.org/sci/software/eclipse/eug/eug/node8.html). The main limitation is 
that they are stand-alone programs useable only in a terminal. They can not be used natively 
inside another program. 

The python module presented in this paper, dfitspy, is a project that migrates the main dfits 
and fitsort capabilities to python. It is a metadata searcher/displayer for FITS files. 
As dfits and fitsort, dfitspy is able to display in the terminal the result of a metadata 
search and is able to grep certain values of keywords inside large samples of files. 
Therefore it can be used directly with the command line interface. Nevertheless, 
dfitspy can be, and it is its strength, imported as a python module and the user can 
use these functionnalities inside another python code or the python interpretor.


# dfitspy as a terminal command
A command line interface has been included in dfitspy so it can be used as a Terminal command. A typical command is:\

``dfitspy -f Test_data/* -k author,number,type --grep 2dspec``\

This command will search is all the FITS file contained in the \textit{Test_data} directory. Dfitspy will search for three keywords in the header: author, time and type. Finally, the terminal will display only the file where both 79098.26 and STD,TELLURIC are in the keyword values. The terminal output is similar to the dfits|fitsort combination. It displays in a column fashion, each file with the requested keyword and value for each keyword.

``----------   ------------      --------        ------``\
``file1.fits   R. Thomas	     49098.26        2dspec``\

``file3.fits   R. Thomas	     69198.26        2dspec``\
``file4.fits   R. Thomas	     79498.26        2dspec``\
``file5.fits   R. Thomas	     89098.26        2dspec``\
``file6.fits   R. Thomas	     79498.26        2dspec``


# dfitspy as a Python module
To be used as a Python module, dfitspy must be imported. Then a set of command have to be used in order to produce the final list of filenames/keywords/values. In short, three main commands must be used:

Import the module:\
``import dfitspy``

First all, the files must be gathered:\
``listfiles = dfitspy.get_files(['all'],'Test_data/')``

Then, one must prepare the list of keywords to look for, and eventually the grepping values:\
``listkeys = ['author', 'time', 'type']``\
``grepping = ['79098.26', 'STD,TELLURIC']``

And finally, we can fitsort the files and eventually grep.\
``fitsortgrep = dfitspy.dfitsort(listfiles, listkeys, grepping)``

The final output is stored as a dictionnary of files for which each keywords/values is given. It can also be displayed in the same way as for the terminal output (see above).
